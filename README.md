### CUSTOMER ANALYSIS REPORT:

	Daniel Hernandez is the customer with the highest loan amount of $49,980.2 having an on-time payment history, followed by Elizabeth Carter with the loan of $49,985.82 having an on-time payment history and lastly Steve Torres with the loan amount of $49,915.49 having a late payment history.
The data shows the correlation between the loan due date and the date the loan was paid.


- Customer Distribution by gender
  
Male amount to 32.68%
Female has the total of 34.54%
Other has 32.78%
There is an even distribution across all genders



- Customer’s Loan Type and Loan Status

Approved and closed for mortgage has the highest count of 591 and 592 respectively, followed by approved and rejected for persona with the count of 553 and 576 respectively and lastly approved and closed of auto having the count of 566 and 554 respectively.



- Top 5 Cities with Highest Approval Rate
  
  Denver has the highest loan approval rate and loan amount of (0.40 and $3.6 million), followed by Washington (0.42 and $3.1 million), Memphis (0.40 and $3.3 million), New York (0.40 and $3.1 million), and Kansas City (0.40 and $2.9 million). This concentration suggests these regions have a strong demand for loans or effective marketing efforts targeting these areas.



### Loan Analysis Report:

- Credit Utilization by loan status
Low credit card utilization has the highest loan status while high credit card utilization has the least, which denotes a good financial management.
 

- Loan Application Status

Total loan application of 5000 was received, 1710 was approved, 1630 was rejected and 1660 was closed.

- Loan Approval Trend across the Months

 The highest loan approval was recorded in March (0.367) while the lowest loan approval was recorded in May (0.324), there is a fall in a wave-like pattern indicating a repeating cycle every few months.




### METRICS OBSERVATION

Reviews vs. Revenue: Products with the most reviews are not always the top revenue drivers.

Smartwatches have high reviews (76) and discount (0.59) but generate lower revenue ($13M) than Smartphones.


 #### Recommendation:

Amazon should consider improving the perceived value or functionality of Smartwatches to increase conversion from reviews to revenue.

Analyze if lower ASP (average selling price) is holding back revenue growth.


### RECOMMENDATIONS

I recommend that Amazon should:

- Revisit discounting strategy for top performers by avoiding over-discounting of items which are already performing well.

- Consider reducing discount rates for high-performing products with inelastic demand.

- Use top-rated, low-cost products as “customer delight” tools—possibly include them as freebies or loyalty rewards.

- Prioritize Smartphones, Smart TVs, and Smartwatches for ad spend, and target upsell to accessories.

- Highlight 5-star rated products with lower visibility in key homepage placements to boost organic sales.

- Understand customer return rates, repeat purchase behavior, and profit margin by category for deeper insights.
