## Project Overview
This report presents a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of banking activity, customer behavior, and loan performance using data provided by The Data Immersed (TDI) warehouse. Using Power BI for data preparation, transformation, and visualization, the objective is to uncover patterns and generate actionable insights to support strategic decisions. The focus lies on understanding customer demographics, loan approval trends, credit utilization behavior, and identifying areas for operational improvement.

### CATEGORY VIEW INSIGHTS

- Top Revenue Generating Categories

 Smartphones $39M, Smart Televisions $26M and Smart Watches $13M

 These are the categories that Dominate revenue, accounting for the bulk of total sales.


- Average Discount % by Category

 Highest 0.9 (Computers & Accessories, Electronics) and Lowest 0.82 (Shower & Wall Mounts)

 High discounts are clustered around tech categories, driving volume sales.


- Product Category with Highest Discount

 Wearable Tech 0.70 and Smartwatches 0.59

 Wearable tech has the highest discount among all, but it doesn’t top revenue or reviews.


### PRODUCT VIEW INSIGHTS

- Top Products by Average Rating (5.0 stars)

 Syncwire LTG to USB Cable, REDTECH USB-C to HDMI Cable, and Amazon Basics USB Extension

 Simple, affordable tech accessories are hitting perfect review scores


- Product with Discount > 50%

 VU 138 cm 4K TV $30K and ECOVACS DEEBOT Vacuum Cleaner $28K

 Premium electronics and appliances are being sold at steep discounts.


- Rating by Price Bucket

 $1,001–$5,000 bucketHighest product count (575)

 Most products fall into this mid-price range.


### METRICS OBSERVATION

Reviews vs. Revenue: Products with the most reviews are not always the top revenue drivers.

Smartwatches have high reviews (76) and discount (0.59) but generate lower revenue ($13M) than Smartphones.


 #### Recommendation:

Amazon should consider improving the perceived value or functionality of Smartwatches to increase conversion from reviews to revenue.

Analyze if lower ASP (average selling price) is holding back revenue growth.


### RECOMMENDATIONS

I recommend that Amazon should:

- Revisit discounting strategy for top performers by avoiding over-discounting of items which are already performing well.

- Consider reducing discount rates for high-performing products with inelastic demand.

- Use top-rated, low-cost products as “customer delight” tools—possibly include them as freebies or loyalty rewards.

- Prioritize Smartphones, Smart TVs, and Smartwatches for ad spend, and target upsell to accessories.

- Highlight 5-star rated products with lower visibility in key homepage placements to boost organic sales.

- Understand customer return rates, repeat purchase behavior, and profit margin by category for deeper insights.
